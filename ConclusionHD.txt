Firstly, I used head command to inspect the data set and selected the columns
â€“ LocationAbbr, Data_value, Stratification1, Stratification2. 

Then I used awk command to print the selected columns. However,I faced a problem while 
using this command as my csv file was already separated, but it kept on changing the column 
heading, so I changed them manually. 
awk -F ',' '{print $2 "," $8 "," $15 "," $17}' Heart_Disease_Mortality_Data_Among_US_Adults__35___by_State
_Territory_and_County.csv > selected_columns.csv

Following this, I used the grep command to analyze the data. It revealed the number of times 
the words- males, females, and overall- were used in the data set i.e. 9885 males, 9928 females, 
and overall(which indicates total number of heart disease mortality cases regardless of their 
gender) 16293 individuals. So, I concluded that there is higher number of female mortality rate 
as compared to males and overall.

Then, I went deeper into the analysis using bar graphs created with pandas and matplotlib. 
This showed some important insights. Firstly, Maryland had a higher rate of heart disease 
deaths compared to other states, indicating a need for targeted interventions in that area.

When I looked at gender, I found that males had a higher rate of heart disease deaths than 
females or the overall population, which confirms my Hypothesis prediction.

Analyzing by race, I discovered that Black individuals faced a higher mortality rate from 
heart disease compared to other racial groups. This highlights the presence of racial 
disparities in heart disease outcomes.

In conclusion, my analysis emphasized the complex nature of heart disease mortality, with 
factors like gender, race, and location playing significant roles. To address these 
disparities, targeted interventions should focus on groups like males,Black individuals, and 
high-risk areas such as Maryland.
