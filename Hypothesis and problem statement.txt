Hypothesis- Numerous factors contribute to the escalating mortality rates from heart disease among individuals aged 35 in the United States, including gender, race, age, and geographical location. However, upon thorough analysis, it becomes evident that men face a disproportionately higher risk of encountering these cardiovascular challenges compared to women. This conclusion is supported by data indicating that the greatest variance in heart disease prevalence among individuals aged 35 in the US is primarily driven by gender, overshadowing considerations related to race or other demographic factors.
Problem statement- At the age of 35, the US citizens tend to have various health issues especially heart disease. This has various reasons behind it. One major reason is the stress of taking care of their elderly as well as their children, they have double duties in such case. I think they are known as sandwich generation. It is also gender specific as men tend to have greater risk of heart disease as compared to women. This is becuase of the presence of estrogen (reprodcutive hormone) in females. Estrogent protects the heart and reduces the risk factors as it lowers the level of bad cholesterol (LDL) and increases the levels of good cholesterol (HDL). However, as estrogen levels decreases after menopause, woment start having more heart diseases. But at the same time, women tend to have differnt symptoms realted to heart disease at this age that includes nausea, fatigue, shortness of breath etc.
