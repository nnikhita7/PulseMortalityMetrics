Project Title: Pulse Mortality Matrix

Hypothesis: There are various factors contributing to the escalating mortality rates from heart disease
among individuals aged(35+) in the United States, including gender, race, age, and geographical location. 
However, upon thorough analysis, it becomes evident that men face a disproportionately higher risk of 
encountering cardiovascular challenges compared to women.

Problem Statement: At the age of 35 and older, US citizens tend to have various health issues, especially 
heart disease. This can be attributed to several factors, one of which is the stress of being part of the
"sandwich generation," where individuals are responsible for caring of both their elderly parents and their
own children simultaneously. This stress is gender-specific,as men tend to have a greater risk of heart disease
compared to women. Estrogen, a reproductive hormone present in females,plays a protective role for the heart by
reducing risk factors such as lowering the level of bad cholesterol (LDL) and increasing the levels of good
cholesterol (HDL). However, as estrogen levels decrease after menopause, women become more susceptible to
heart diseases. Additionally, women tend to experience different symptoms related to heart disease at this age,
including ausea, fatigue, and shortness of breath.

How Data will be Utilized: I will use the data to demonstrate that after controlling for race and other 
demographic factors,there are more heart disease mortalities in men at age 35 than in women. By analyzing the 
mortality rates from heart disease mong individuals aged 35, while controlling for variables such as race, age,
and geographical location, I aim to highlight the disproportionate risk faced by men in developing heart diseases
compared to women.This analysis will provide valuable insights into the gender-specific differences in heart 
disease mortality rates and help in understanding the underlying factors contributing to these differences.

Data source: I used data from data.gov and the name of the data catalog is 'Heart Disease Mortality Data Among US
Adults (35+) by State/ Territory and County’, which was organized by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
and published by Center of Diseases and Prevention. This data provides information on heart mortality rates along
with their gender, geographical area, and race.

Dataset from source: 
https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/i2vk-mgdh/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD

Curl: I downloaded the csv file from the data source, and I uploaded it in GitHub, from where I made this curl. 
https://github.com/nnikhita7/PulseMortalityMetrics/raw/main/Heart_Disease_Mortality_Data_Among_US_Adults__35___by_State
_Territory_and_County.csv

Inspect data using head and select column: I used head command to inspect the data set and selected the columns
– LocationAbbr, Data_value, Stratification1, Stratification2.
 
Used awk command to process data: This is the awk command that I used to print the selected columns. However,I 
faced a problem while using this - my csv file was already separated, but when I was using this command, it kept
on changing the column heading, so I changed them manually. 
awk -F ',' '{print $2 "," $8 "," $15 "," $17}' Heart_Disease_Mortality_Data_Among_US_Adults__35___by_State
_Territory_and_County.csv > selected_columns.csv

Grep and count command: I used ‘grep – c Male selected_columns.csv’ command to calculate the number of male 
members affected from heart/cardiovascular diseases which was 9885 and for females, it was 9928. For the race, 
black number was 6038, Hispanic was 5232, and white was 6886. 

Analysis: I predicted that the male mortality rate because of cardiovascular disease would be more than the female
mortality rate. But according to my dataset, females have higher mortality rate as compared to males.

Conclusion: at the starting of this project, I predicted that there would be higher number of the male individuals
that suffer from heart diseases as compared to the female individuals. However, after analyzing all the factors in the 
dataset, it is concluded that there is higher female mortality rate than the males.
